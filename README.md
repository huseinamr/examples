# tutorials
I love doing tutorials, especially on programming. But when the time comes for me to apply what I learned from the tutorials, I sometimes forget what I should do. When this happens, I have to dig through the entire tutorials again (even tutorials that I've completed months ago). This can be very frustrating. That's why I created this repository so that I can easily look up codes I've learned before.

As a bonus, anyone can also come here and learn many things that I've learned!
